# Meet_up_scheduler
marihacks 2020

# We built this during Marihacks 2020
### Our project idea was to build a program that allows the user to input a schedule and have it be stored online. Then, the main function is for comparing schedules with other users to find common breaks. We also wanted to put the program on a website and include a live chat feature, but we couldn't implement these features and our core program is still incomplete.
